ICD Projects
============

There are currently two ICD subprojects:

* icd - supports validating an ICD against the JSON schema as well as saving it as a Markdown, HTML or PDF document
* icd-db - supports injesting an ICD into the database, querying the db and saving an ICD as a document
* icd-web - ICD web app (TBD)
